Many parts of our body go into the making of the sounds which we utter and the 
words which we say to one another. Speech starts when the diaphram squeezes air out of our lungs and into the windpipe.
At the top end of the windpipe is the larynx, or ‘Adam’s apple’-that is the hard bit you can feel at the front of your neck. 
Inside the larynx are the vocal cords, two bands of elastic tissue like a strings of a violin. As the air passes over these cords,
they vibrate to produce sound.
Sound is turned into words when it reaches the mouth, by movments of the tongue and lips.

"Apple logo" redirects here. For the programming language, see Apple Logo.
According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a fruitarian diet. Jobs thought the name "Apple" was "fun, spirited and not intimidating".[267]
Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's "rainbow Apple", the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the "bitten" logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. However, Jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company.[268][269] The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.[270] The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.[270] This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.[271][272] Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.[270][273]
On August 27, 1999[274] (the year following the introduction of the iMac G3), Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation. An Aqua-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 1998 to 2003, and a glass-themed version was used from 2007 to 2013.[275]
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were Beatles fans,[276][277] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1967. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with the settling of their lawsuit in 2007.[278]
Advertising
Main article: Apple Inc. advertising
Apple's first slogan, "Byte into an Apple", was coined in the late 1970s.[279] From 1997 to 2002, the slogan "Think Different" was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.[280] Apple also has slogans for specific product lines — for example, "iThink, therefore iMac" was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,[281] and "Say hello to iPhone" has been used in iPhone advertisements.[282] "Hello" was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, Newton, iMac ("hello (again)"), and iPod.[283]
From the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, with the 1984 Super Bowl commercial to the more modern 'Get a Mac' adverts, Apple has been recognized for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns were criticized,[284] particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.[285] Apple's product commercials gained a lot of attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.[286] Musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on Apple commercials include Canadian singer Feist with the song "1234" and Yael Naïm with the song "New Soul".[286]
Apple owns a YouTube channel where they release advertisements, tips, and introductions for their devices.[287][288]
Brand loyalty
"The scenes I witnessed at the opening of the new Apple store in London's Covent Garden were more like an evangelical prayer meeting than a chance to buy a phone or a laptop."
—Alex Riley, writing for the BBC[289]
Apple customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty early in the company's history. BYTE in 1984 stated that[290]
There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say Apple isn't just a company, it's a cause; and people who say Apple isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right. Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned.
Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets. The company's growth from two guys to a billion-dollar corporation exemplifies the American Dream. Even as a large corporation, Apple plays David to IBM's Goliath, and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth.
Apple aficionados wait in line around an Apple Store in Shanghai in anticipation of a new product.
Apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time, but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established. Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism "something that was stumbled upon,"[291] while Ive explained in 2014 that "People have an incredibly personal relationship" with Apple's products.[61] Apple Store openings and new product releases can draw crowds of hundreds, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening.[292][293][294][295] The opening of New York City's Fifth Avenue "Cube" store in 2006 became the setting of a marriage proposal, and had visitors from Europe who flew in for the event.[296] In June 2017, a newlywed couple took their wedding photos inside the then-recently opened Orchard Road Apple Store in Singapore.[297][298] The high level of brand loyalty has been criticized and ridiculed, applying the epithet "Apple fanboy" and mocking the lengthy lines before a product launch.[299] An internal memo leaked in 2015 suggested the company planned to discourage long lines and direct customers to purchase its products on its website.[300]
Fortune magazine named Apple the most admired company in the United States in 2008, and in the world from 2008 to 2012.[301][302][303][304][305] On September 30, 2013, Apple surpassed Coca-Cola to become the world's most valuable brand in the Omnicom Group's "Best Global Brands" report.[306] Boston Consulting Group has ranked Apple as the world's most innovative brand every year since 2005.[307]
The New York Times in 1985 stated that "Apple above all else is a marketing company".[308] John Sculley agreed, telling The Guardian newspaper in 1997 that "People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company. It was the marketing company of the decade."[309] Research in 2002 by NetRatings indicate that the average Apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other PC company consumers. The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average Apple Inc. products were more expensive than other PC products.[310][311]
In response to a query about the devotion of loyal Apple consumers, Jonathan Ive responded:
What people are responding to is much bigger than the object. They are responding to something rare—a group of people who do more than simply make something work, they make the very best products they possibly can. It's a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness.[61]

In 2006, Apple announced its intention to build a second campus in Cupertino about 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the current campus and next to Interstate 280.[330] The new campus building has been designed by Norman Foster.[331] The Cupertino City Council approved the proposed "spaceship" design campus on October 15, 2013, after a 2011 presentation by Jobs detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs. The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central, four-storied, circular building surrounded by extensive landscape. It will feature a café with room for 3,000 sitting people and parking underground as well as in a parking structure. The 2.8 million square foot facility will also include Jobs's original designs for a fitness center and a corporate auditorium.[332]

Apple has expanded its campuses in Austin, Texas concurrently with building Apple Park in Cupertino. The expansion consists of two locations, with one having 1.1 million square feet of workspace, and the other 216,000 square feet.[333] At the biggest location, 6,000 employees work on technical support, manage Apple's network of suppliers to fulfill product shipments, aid in maintaining iTunes Store and App Store, handle economy, and continuously update Apple Maps with new data. At its smaller campus, 500 engineers work on next-generation processor chips to run in future Apple products.[334]
Apple's headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland.[335][336][337][338][339][340][341] The facility, which opened in 1980, was Apple's first location outside of the United States.[342] Apple Sales International, which deals with all of Apple's international sales outside of the USA, is located at Apple's campus in Cork[343] along with Apple Distribution International, which similarly deals with Apple's international distribution network.[344] On April 20, 2012, Apple added 500 new jobs at its European headquarters, increasing the total workforce from around 2,800 to 3,300 employees.[332][336][345] The company will build a new office block on its Hollyhill Campus to accommodate the additional staff.[346] Its United Kingdom headquarters is at Stockley Park on the outskirts of London.[347]
In February 2015, Apple opened their new 180,000-square-foot headquarters in Herzliya, Israel, which will accommodate approximately 800 employees. This opening was Apple's third office located within Israel; the first, also in Herzliya, was obtained as part of the Anobit acquisition, and the other is a research center in Haifa.[348][349]
In December 2015, Apple bought the 70,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in North San Jose previously used by Maxim Integrated, in an $18.2 million deal.[350][351]
Stores
Main article: Apple Store
The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs,[352] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.[353] Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired Ron Johnson in 2000.[353] Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997,[354] and opened the first two physical stores in 2001.[352] Despite initial media speculation that Apple would fail,[355] its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.[355] Over the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 499 stores across 22 countries worldwide as of December 2017.[356] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.[357]
In May 2016, Angela Ahrendts, Apple's current Senior Vice President of Retail, unveiled a significantly redesigned Apple Store in Union Square, San Francisco, featuring large glass doors for the entry, open spaces, and rebranded rooms. In addition to purchasing products, consumers can get advice and help from "Creative Pros" – individuals with specialized knowledge of creative arts; get product support in a tree-lined Genius Grove; and attend sessions, conferences and community events,[358][359] with Ahrendts commenting that the goal is to make Apple Stores into "town squares", a place where people naturally meet up and spend time.[360] The new design will be applied to all Apple Stores worldwide,[361] a process that has seen stores temporarily relocate[362] or close.[363]
Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone "flagship" stores in high-profile locations.[353] It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes.[364] The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores.[365][366] Apple's notable brand loyalty among consumers causes long lines of hundreds of people at new Apple Store openings or product releases.[292][293][294][295] Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives a large number of job applications, many of which come from young workers.[357] Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts,[357] there are limited or no paths of career advancement.[357] A May 2016 report with an anonymous retail employee highlighted a hostile work environment with harassment from customers, intense internal criticism, and a lack of significant bonuses for securing major business contracts.[367]
