Main article: Apple Inc. litigation
Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.[519] In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include Apple v. Samsung, Apple v. Microsoft, Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc., and Apple Corps v. Apple Computer. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights. Most have been dismissed in the courts as shell companies known as patent trolls, with no evidence of actual use of patents in question.[520] On December 21, 2016, Nokia announced that in the U.S. and Germany, it has filed a suit against Apple, claiming that the latter's products infringe on Nokia's patents.[521][522] Most recently, in November 2017, the United States International Trade Commission announced an investigation into allegations of patent infringement in regards to Apple's remote desktop technology; Aqua Connect, a company that builds remote desktop software, has claimed that Apple infringed on two of its patents.[523]
Privacy stance
Apple has a notable pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.[524][525][526] With its iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encryption all contents of iOS devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible for the company to provide customer data to law enforcement requests seeking such information.[527] With the popularity rise of cloud storage solutions, Apple began a technique in 2016 to do deep learning scans for facial data in photos on the user's local device and encrypting the content before uploading it to Apple's iCloud storage system.[528] It also introduced "differential privacy", a way to collect crowdsourced data from many users, while keeping individual users anonymous, in a system that Wired described as "trying to learn as much as possible about a group while learning as little as possible about any individual in it".[529] Users are explicitly asked if they want to participate, and can actively opt-in or opt-out.[530]
That said, Apple aids law enforcement in criminal investigations by providing iCloud backups of users' devices,[531][532] and the company's commitment to privacy has been questioned by its efforts to promote biometric authentication technology in its newer iPhone models, which don't have the same level of constitutional privacy as a passcode in the United States.[533]
Charitable causes
Apple is a partner of (PRODUCT)RED, a fundraising campaign for AIDS charity. In November 2014, Apple arranged for all App Store revenue in a two-week period to go to the fundraiser,[534] generating more than US$20 million,[535][536] and in March 2017, it released an iPhone 7 with a red color finish.[537][538]
Apple contributes financially to fundraisers in times of natural disasters. In November 2012, it donated $2.5 million to the American Red Cross to aid relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy,[539] and in 2017 it donated $5 million to relief efforts for both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey,[540] as well as for the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake.[541] The company has also used its iTunes platform to encourage donations, including, but not limited to, help the American Red Cross in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake,[542] followed by similar procedure in the aftermath of the 2011 Japan earthquake,[543] Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in November 2013,[544] and European migrant crisis in September 2015.[545] Apple emphasizes that it does not incur any processing or other fees for iTunes donations, sending 100% of the payments directly to relief efforts, though it also acknowledges that the Red Cross does not receive any personal information on the users donating and that the payments may not be tax deductible.[546]
On April 14, 2016, Apple and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, "help protect life on our planet." Apple released a special page in the iTunes App Store, Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF's Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8 million in total proceeds to support WWF's conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.[547][548][549]
Criticism and controversies

This section should include a better summary of Criticism of Apple Inc.. See Wikipedia:Summary style for information on how to properly incorporate it into this article's main text. (November 2017)
Main article: Criticism of Apple Inc.
Apple has been criticised for its unethical business practices such as anti-competitive behavior, rash litigation,[550] and dubious tax tactics, their production methods involving the use of sweatshop labor,[551][552][553] customer service issues involving misleading warranties and insufficient data security, as well as its products' environmental footprint. Apple's products have been claimed by critics to combine stolen and/or purchased designs that it claims are its own original creations.[554][555] Additionally, it has also been criticized for its alleged collaboration with the U.S. surveillance program PRISM.[556][557]
